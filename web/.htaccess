# I *strongly* urge you to turn on authentication for Beirdobot congfiguration.
# It is disabled by default because it requires you to set up your own password
# file.  Please see the man page for htdigest and then configure the folowing
# directives to suit your authentication needs.
#
#    AuthType           Digest
#    AuthName           "Beirdobot"
#    AuthDigestFile     /var/www/htdigest

    # Use the following environment settings to tell Beirdobot where you want it
    # to look to connect to the database, the name of the database to connect
    # to, and the authentication info to use to connect.  The defaults will
    # usually work fine unless you've change the bot's commandline options, or
    # are running Beirdobot on a different server from your database.  Make sure
    # you have mod_env enabled.
