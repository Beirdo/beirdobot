OPIE Software Distribution, Release 2.31              Installation Instructions
========================================              =========================

	Did you read the README file?

	If not, please go do so, then come back here. There is information in
the README file that you will probably need to know in order to build and use
OPIE, and you are better off doing it before you try to compile and install
it.

	OPIE uses Autoconf to automagically figure out as much as possible
about your system. There are four steps to installing OPIE. Please read them
all first before attempting to do them.

1. Run the "configure" script.

	Normally, you will need to type:

	sh configure

	If you would like to use an access file to allow users from some hosts
to log into your system without using OTPs (thus opening up a big security
hole, but a necessary evil for some sites), type:

	sh configure --enable-access-file=/etc/opieaccess

	If you'd like the file to go somewhere else, adjust this appropriately.

	There are a number of configure-time options available for OPIE. To
get a list, type:

	sh configure --help

2. Edit the Makefile

	The Makefile contains some options that you may wish to modify. Also
verify that Autoconf chose the correct options for your system.

	The Makefile created by Autoconf should be correct for most users
as-is.

3. Build OPIE

	Normally, you will need to type:

	make

	If you only want to build the client programs, type:

	make client

	If you only want to build the server programs, type:

	make server

4. Verify that OPIE works on your system and install

	Normall, you will need to type:

	make install

	If you only want to install the client programs, type:

	make client-install

	If you only want to install the server programs, type:

	make server-install

	If you encounter any problems, you may be able to run "make uninstall"
to remove the OPIE software from your system and revert back to almost the
way things were before.
